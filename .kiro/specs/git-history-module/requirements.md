# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a core git history module that provides a standardized interface for scripts to analyze git repository data. The module will serve as the foundation for engineering analytics tools that help leaders understand individual and team behavior and performance patterns. It will extract, parse, and structure git history data in a way that makes it accessible for various analysis scripts and future AI-powered interactive queries.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a script developer, I want to access structured git commit data, so that I can build analytics tools without dealing with raw git command parsing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a script imports the git history module THEN the system SHALL provide a clean API for accessing commit data
2. WHEN requesting commit data THEN the system SHALL return structured objects with commit hash, author, timestamp, message, and file changes
3. WHEN processing large repositories THEN the system SHALL handle memory efficiently without loading entire history at once
4. IF a repository path is invalid THEN the system SHALL throw a descriptive error

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a script developer, I want to filter git history by various criteria, so that I can focus analysis on specific time periods, authors, or file patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN filtering by date range THEN the system SHALL return only commits within the specified timeframe
2. WHEN filtering by author THEN the system SHALL support both exact matches and pattern matching
3. WHEN filtering by file paths THEN the system SHALL support glob patterns and directory filtering
4. WHEN combining multiple filters THEN the system SHALL apply all filters using AND logic
5. IF no commits match the filter criteria THEN the system SHALL return an empty result set

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a script developer, I want to access detailed file change information, so that I can analyze code modification patterns and impact.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN retrieving commit data THEN the system SHALL include file paths, change types (added/modified/deleted), and line change counts
2. WHEN analyzing file changes THEN the system SHALL provide both summary statistics and detailed diff information
3. WHEN processing merge commits THEN the system SHALL handle them appropriately and indicate their special status
4. IF diff data is unavailable THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle the missing information

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a script developer, I want to query git history with flexible parameters, so that I can build diverse analytics without modifying the core module.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN querying commits THEN the system SHALL support pagination for large result sets
2. WHEN requesting specific fields THEN the system SHALL allow selective data retrieval to optimize performance
3. WHEN sorting results THEN the system SHALL support sorting by timestamp, author, or commit hash
4. WHEN working with branches THEN the system SHALL allow specifying which branches to include in analysis

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a script developer, I want the module to handle different git repository configurations, so that it works across various project setups.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN working with local repositories THEN the system SHALL automatically detect the git root directory
2. WHEN processing repositories with submodules THEN the system SHALL handle them appropriately
3. WHEN encountering different git configurations THEN the system SHALL adapt to various author name/email formats
4. IF git is not available or repository is corrupted THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a script developer, I want TypeScript type definitions, so that I can build type-safe analytics tools with good IDE support.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the module in TypeScript THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive type definitions
2. WHEN accessing commit data THEN the system SHALL enforce type safety for all data structures
3. WHEN using filtering options THEN the system SHALL provide typed interfaces for all configuration options
4. WHEN handling errors THEN the system SHALL use typed error classes for better error handling
