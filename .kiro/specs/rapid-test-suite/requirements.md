# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will create a rapid and comprehensive test suite system that enables developers to quickly generate, run, and maintain automated tests across their codebase. The system should provide intelligent test generation, fast execution, comprehensive coverage analysis, and seamless integration with existing development workflows.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to automatically generate comprehensive test cases for my code, so that I can ensure thorough coverage without manually writing every test.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer runs the test generation command THEN the system SHALL analyze the codebase and generate appropriate unit tests for all functions and methods
2. WHEN generating tests THEN the system SHALL create test cases for edge cases, error conditions, and happy path scenarios
3. WHEN analyzing code THEN the system SHALL identify dependencies and mock them appropriately in generated tests
4. IF a function has complex logic THEN the system SHALL generate multiple test cases covering different execution paths

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to run tests rapidly with intelligent selection, so that I can get quick feedback during development without waiting for the entire suite.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer makes code changes THEN the system SHALL identify and run only affected tests
2. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL execute tests in parallel to minimize execution time
3. WHEN test execution begins THEN the system SHALL provide real-time progress feedback
4. IF tests fail THEN the system SHALL prioritize showing the most critical failures first

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive coverage reporting with actionable insights, so that I can identify gaps in my testing strategy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests complete THEN the system SHALL generate detailed coverage reports showing line, branch, and function coverage
2. WHEN coverage is below threshold THEN the system SHALL highlight specific areas needing additional tests
3. WHEN viewing coverage reports THEN the system SHALL provide visual indicators for covered and uncovered code paths
4. IF coverage decreases THEN the system SHALL alert developers and suggest specific improvements

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want seamless integration with my development workflow, so that testing becomes a natural part of my coding process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is saved THEN the system SHALL automatically run relevant tests in the background
2. WHEN using version control THEN the system SHALL integrate with git hooks to run tests on commits and pushes
3. WHEN working in an IDE THEN the system SHALL provide inline test results and coverage indicators
4. IF tests fail during CI/CD THEN the system SHALL provide clear, actionable error messages

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want flexible test configuration and customization options, so that I can adapt the test suite to my project's specific needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the test suite THEN the system SHALL allow configuration of test frameworks, coverage thresholds, and execution preferences
2. WHEN working with different file types THEN the system SHALL support multiple programming languages and test frameworks
3. WHEN customizing behavior THEN the system SHALL allow developers to define custom test patterns and exclusion rules
4. IF project requirements change THEN the system SHALL allow easy reconfiguration without losing existing test data

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want intelligent test maintenance and optimization, so that my test suite remains efficient and relevant over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests become outdated THEN the system SHALL identify and suggest updates to obsolete tests
2. WHEN duplicate test logic is detected THEN the system SHALL recommend consolidation opportunities
3. WHEN test execution time increases THEN the system SHALL suggest performance optimizations
4. IF code refactoring occurs THEN the system SHALL automatically update affected test cases where possible
