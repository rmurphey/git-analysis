# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves setting up a new Git repository with TypeScript configuration and automated testing infrastructure from the start. The goal is to establish a solid foundation for TypeScript development with proper tooling, testing framework, and CI/CD pipeline configuration that enables immediate development with best practices.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to initialize a Git repository with proper configuration, so that I can start version controlling my TypeScript project immediately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the setup is executed THEN the system SHALL initialize a new Git repository in the current directory
2. WHEN the Git repository is created THEN the system SHALL create a comprehensive .gitignore file that excludes TypeScript build artifacts, node_modules, and common development files
3. WHEN the repository is initialized THEN the system SHALL create an initial commit with the basic project structure

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want TypeScript configured with modern settings, so that I can write type-safe code with the latest language features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN TypeScript is configured THEN the system SHALL create a tsconfig.json with strict type checking enabled
2. WHEN TypeScript is configured THEN the system SHALL set the target to ES2020 or later for modern JavaScript features
3. WHEN TypeScript is configured THEN the system SHALL configure module resolution for Node.js compatibility
4. WHEN TypeScript is configured THEN the system SHALL set up source maps for debugging support

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated testing configured from the start, so that I can write and run tests immediately without additional setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing is configured THEN the system SHALL install and configure Jest as the testing framework
2. WHEN testing is configured THEN the system SHALL set up TypeScript support for Jest with ts-jest
3. WHEN testing is configured THEN the system SHALL create a sample test file to verify the setup works
4. WHEN testing is configured THEN the system SHALL configure test scripts in package.json for running tests

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want package.json configured with essential scripts and dependencies, so that I can manage the project and run common tasks easily.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN package.json is created THEN the system SHALL include TypeScript as a development dependency
2. WHEN package.json is created THEN the system SHALL include testing dependencies (Jest, ts-jest, @types/jest)
3. WHEN package.json is created THEN the system SHALL define build, test, and development scripts
4. WHEN package.json is created THEN the system SHALL set up proper project metadata (name, version, description)

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want development tooling configured, so that I can have a smooth development experience with linting and formatting.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN development tooling is configured THEN the system SHALL install and configure ESLint for TypeScript
2. WHEN development tooling is configured THEN the system SHALL install and configure Prettier for code formatting
3. WHEN development tooling is configured THEN the system SHALL create configuration files for both ESLint and Prettier
4. WHEN development tooling is configured THEN the system SHALL add lint and format scripts to package.json

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a basic project structure created, so that I can start developing immediately with organized code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project structure is created THEN the system SHALL create a src directory for source code
2. WHEN the project structure is created THEN the system SHALL create a tests or __tests__ directory for test files
3. WHEN the project structure is created THEN the system SHALL create a basic index.ts file as an entry point
4. WHEN the project structure is created THEN the system SHALL create a README.md with setup and usage instructions
