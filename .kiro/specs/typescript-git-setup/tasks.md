  - Implement npm scripts configuration for build, test, lint, format, and development workflows
  - Add TypeScript, Jest, ESLint, and Prettier as development dependencies with specific versions
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_

- [ ] 4. Implement TypeScript configuration
  - Create tsconfig.json with modern, strict TypeScript settings targeting ES2022

  - Create sample test file to verify Jest and TypeScript integration works
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4_

- [ ] 6. Configure development tooling (ESLint and Prettier)
  - Create ESLint configuration for TypeScript with recommended rules and Prettier integration
  - Write Prettier configuration file with consistent formatting rules
  - Create .eslintignore file to exclude build artifacts and dependencies
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4_

- [ ] 7. Create project directory structure and sample files
  - Write code to create src/ directory and __tests__ subdirectory structure
  - Create sample index.ts file with basic TypeScript code and proper exports
  - Generate example test file that demonstrates Jest and TypeScript working together
  - _Requirements: 6.1, 6.2, 6.3_

- [ ] 8. Generate comprehensive README.md documentation
  - Write README.md with project setup instructions and usage examples
  - Document filesystem structure decisions and rationale for directory organization

  - _Requirements: 6.4_

- [ ] 9. Implement dependency installation automation
  - Write code to automatically run npm install after package.json creation
  - Add error handling for network issues and dependency resolution problems
  - Verify all dependencies are correctly installed and compatible
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2_

- [ ] 10. Create setup script cleanup mechanism
  - Implement self-cleaning functionality to remove setup scripts after successful execution
  - Add verification that all components are working before cleanup
  - Create final validation tests to ensure the setup is complete and functional
  - _Requirements: All requirements verification_

- [ ] 11. Add comprehensive error handling and rollback
  - Write error handling for each setup step with descriptive error messages
  - Implement rollback functionality to clean up partial setups on failure
  - Create validation checks to ensure each step completed successfully before proceeding
  - _Requirements: All requirements_

- [ ] 12. Write integration tests for the setup process
  - Create automated tests that verify the entire setup process works correctly
  - Test that all generated files have correct content and structure
  - Verify that npm scripts work and TypeScript compilation succeeds
  - _Requirements: 3.4, 4.3_
