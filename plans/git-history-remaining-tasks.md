# Git History Module - Remaining Tasks Plan

## Current Status
âœ… **COMPLETED**:
- Task 2: Core TypeScript interfaces and error hierarchy
- Task 3: Simple-Git wrapper component with git operations  
- Task 4: Data processing and enhancement layer
- Task 5: Query engine basic structure (stubbed for use-case driven development)

## Remaining Implementation Tasks

### Task 6: Create main GitHistoryModule API class
- [ ] Implement the primary public interface with all query methods
- [ ] Integrate GitWrapper, GitDataProcessor, and GitQueryEngine components
- [ ] Add repository information and utility methods
- [ ] Implement proper error propagation and handling
- [ ] Write integration tests for the complete API
- **Requirements**: 1.1, 1.4, 4.2, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3

### Task 7: Add optional caching functionality
- [ ] Implement GitCacheManager for performance optimization
- [ ] Add configurable caching to frequently accessed data
- [ ] Create cache invalidation strategies
- [ ] Write unit tests for cache operations and TTL behavior
- **Requirements**: 1.3, 4.2

### Task 8: Implement comprehensive error handling
- [ ] Ensure all git operations have proper error handling with typed exceptions
- [ ] Add validation for repository paths and query parameters
- [ ] Create user-friendly error messages for common failure scenarios
- [ ] Write unit tests for all error conditions and edge cases
- **Requirements**: 1.4, 2.5, 5.4

### Task 9: Create integration tests with real repositories
- [ ] Set up test repositories with controlled commit history for integration testing
- [ ] Test all query methods against real git data
- [ ] Verify performance with larger repositories
- [ ] Test edge cases like merge commits, binary files, and repository configurations
- **Requirements**: All major requirements for end-to-end validation

### Task 10: Add module exports and finalize public API
- [ ] Create clean module exports with proper TypeScript declarations
- [ ] Ensure all public interfaces are properly exported
- [ ] Add JSDoc documentation for all public methods and interfaces
- [ ] Verify TypeScript compilation and type checking works correctly
- **Requirements**: 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4

### Task 11: Create comprehensive test suite and documentation
- [ ] Write end-to-end tests demonstrating typical usage patterns
- [ ] Create performance benchmarks for different repository sizes
- [ ] Add example usage code and documentation
- [ ] Verify all requirements are covered by tests
- **Requirements**: Complete coverage validation

## Future Enhancement Tasks (To be implemented based on analysis script needs)

### Query Engine Enhancements
- [ ] Date range filtering implementation
- [ ] Author pattern matching and filtering
- [ ] File path and glob pattern filtering
- [ ] Sorting by date, author, hash
- [ ] Advanced pagination with cursor-based navigation

### Performance Optimizations
- [ ] Streaming for large result sets
- [ ] Background prefetching strategies
- [ ] Memory-efficient processing for large repositories
- [ ] Query result caching and invalidation

### Analysis-Specific Features (Driven by actual use cases)
- [ ] Commit frequency analysis helpers
- [ ] Author contribution statistics
- [ ] File change pattern analysis
- [ ] Branch and merge analysis utilities
- [ ] Custom analysis pipeline support

## Success Criteria
- All core interfaces work with real git repositories
- Performance acceptable for repositories with 10k+ commits
- Complete TypeScript type safety and IntelliSense support
- Comprehensive error handling with meaningful messages
- Modular architecture allows easy extension for analysis scripts
- Documentation and examples enable easy adoption

## Next Steps
1. Implement Task 6 (main API class) to provide a usable interface
2. Add basic integration tests to validate against real repositories
3. Implement remaining tasks based on analysis script requirements
4. Defer query engine enhancements until concrete filtering needs emerge
